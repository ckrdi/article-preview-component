## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass

### What I learned

I learn about relative positioning and absolute positioning.

### Useful resources

- [Absolute, Relative, Fixed Positioning: How Do They Differ?](https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/) - This helped me for understanding position in HTML.
- [Absolute Positioning Inside Relative Positioning](https://css-tricks.com/absolute-positioning-inside-relative-positioning/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand parent-child relationship in positioning. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
